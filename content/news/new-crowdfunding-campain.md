**Hey GRASS GIS friends!**

We just launched a crowd funding campaign to partially cover the costs of refreshing and re-styling our website https://grass.osgeo.org to newer standards.

Details about our plans for the website migration in 2019 can find on the wiki: https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Website_migration_plan_2019

For the realization we need your support, any contribution counts and is most welcome ! You can easily contribute any amount through our PayPal money pool:

Thank you very much for your support
