GRASS - **Geographic Resources Analysis Support System** has been under continuous development since 1982 (!).

The strength and success of GRASS GIS relies on the **user community** to improve and extend the GRASS GIS capabilities.
GRASS GIS is developed and supported by a [worldwide developers team](https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/blob/master/contributors.csv)

Many people have contributed to the GRASS GIS. Without them, GRASS GIS would not exist in its current form.
The authors of the individual programs are listed at the end of the respective manual pages.
